# The xAPI Overview
Broadly defined, the Experience API (xAPI) lets applications share data about human performance.  More precisely, xAPI lets you capture (big) data on human performance, along with associated instructional content or performance context information.  xAPI applies human (and machine) readable “activity streams” to tracking data and provides sub-APIs to access and store information about state and content.  This enables nearly dynamic tracking of activities from any platform or software system—from traditional Learning Management Systems (LMSs) to mobile devices, simulations, wearables, physical beacons.

xAPI is 100% free, open source, lightweight, and adaptable; it can be used to augment almost any performance assessment situation. It is currently being used in many LMSs, museums, flight simulators, firing ranges, and emergency medical services.
