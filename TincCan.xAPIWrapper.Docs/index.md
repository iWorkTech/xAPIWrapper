## Quick Start Notes:
1. TINCAN Standard Library is a .NET Standard 1.6 compatible library
2. It's a port of the JavaScript xAPIWrapper implemented in C#
3. It can be used to interface with any LRS
4. The library can be used with platforms that support the .NET Standard
5. The xAPIWrapper eliminates the need for client/end user to know the internals of the TINCAN specification
6. The xAPIWrapper implemention makes generating statements as easy as adding Log statetments to your code
